Python module for Sumokoin
========================

Welcome to the documentation for the ``sumokoin`` Python module.

The aim of this project is to offer a set of tools for interacting with Sumokoin
cryptocurrency in Python. It provides higher level classes representing objects
from the Sumokoin environment, like wallets, accounts, addresses, transactions.

Currently it operates over JSON RPC protocol, however other backends are
planned as well.
